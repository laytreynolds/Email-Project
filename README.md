# Email-Project

This is the final project of my QA Academy Software Development course. The project
puts together Agile methodologies, Java fundamentals and back-end, server side
requests.

The application takes the details of a user snd stores them in an external database. Users can then use CRUD to interact with the database via HTTP requests.

The end goal is build a seperate, interactive command line in which the user interacts with the CLI and the data is posted to the database through the HTTP requests.


**Why Are We Doing This?**
This is an accumulation of all the knowledge we have learnt on the course so far and how we apply this knowledge in practical situations.


**How I Expected the Challenge To Go?**
I knew the challenge was going to be tough. The topics covered regarding HTTP requests are complex and need to be done correct to work.


**What went well?**
the task as a whole went better than I thought. I managed to get a working CRUD application done within the first 48 hours which was a relief. The Rest of my time was focused on test coverage and Additional features.


**What didn't go as planned?**
Connecting to a database was a tough start to the project as I have been having issues all week. This is a case of merely debugging and testing different fixes in order to get the connection. In the end, it worked by creating the database first, then connecting through the Spring API.

**Possible improvements for future revisions of the project?**
