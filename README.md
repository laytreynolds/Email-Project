# Email-Project

This is the final project of my QA Academy Software Development course. The project
puts together Agile methodologies, Java fundamentals and back-end, server side
requests.


Why Are We Doing This?

This is an accumulation of all the knowledge we have learnt on the course so far and how we apply this knowledge in practical situations. 

How I Expected the Challenge To Go?


What went well? 


What didn't go as planned?


Possible improvements for future revisions of the project?
