# Email-Project

This is the final project of my QA Academy Software Development course. The project
puts together Agile methodologies, Java fundamentals and back-end, server side
requests.

The application takes the details of a user snd stores them in an external database. Users can then use CRUD to interact with the database via HTTP requests.

The end goal is build a seperate, interactive command line in which the user interacts with the CLI and the data is posted to the database through the HTTP requests.


**Why Are We Doing This?
**
This is an accumulation of all the knowledge we have learnt on the course so far and how we apply this knowledge in practical situations.


How I Expected the Challenge To Go?

I knew the challenge was going to be tough. The topics covered regarding HTTP requests are complex and need to be done correct to work.


What went well? 

the task as a whole went better than I thought. I managed to get a working CRUD application done within the first 48 hours which was a relief. The Rest of my time was focused on test coverage and Additional features.


What didn't go as planned?

Connecting to a database was a tough start to the project as I have been having issues all week. This is a case of merely debugging and testing different fixes in order to get the connection. In the end, it worked by creating the database first, then connecting through the Spring API.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project?
